Lenora, in the context of this website, refers to its theme. It is a theme for the
Hugo static-site generator, and is currently being used for this very site. It
utilizes TailwindCSS and a full-bleed CSS grid layout.

<!--more-->

What this means is that content is centered and takes about 1/2 to 2/3 of the screen
(depending on the actual screen width), while certain things, such as certain media or
the horizontal rules separating the content, take up much more of the screen. It's main
color scheme is black with a pastel purple color, which are the favorite colors of the
person this theme is named after (my girlfiend).

This theme has its own repo [here](https://github.com/leggettc18/lenora).
