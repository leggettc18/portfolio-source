My name is Christopher Leggett, I'm an East Carolina University Graduate with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science. I am currently an IT technician by trade but my end goal is to be a Full Stack or Backend Developer.  

This Portfolio/Blog is written in Hugo and is using a customized theme, which I call Lenora (after my girlfriend). It leverages TailwindCSS, if you would like to use it for your site, the Github link is [here](https://github.com/leggettc18/lenora/).
